This project explores the relationship between retirement status, demography, aging, health, and financial status.  

**Problem Description**:  
The rapid increase in the aging population has generated challenges to labor supply and social economical sustainability in many developed and developing countries (1, 2, 3). Individuals 65 years and older accounted for ~13% of the population in 2011 in the US. This percentage is expected to grow to 20% by 2050 (4). As the aging population in the US increases and its impacts on personal health, economic output, and healthcare systems continue, the need to understand healthy aging and factors to minimize burden on the individual and society becomes imperative.  
The project will use The Health and Retirement 2018 Core Early Release (Version 1.0) data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS is a multi-year longitudinal study of Americans over the age of 50 and their spouses directed by the University of Michigan and funded by the National Institute on Aging and the Social Security Administration The 2018 HRS Core (Early, Version 1.0) is an early public release that includes cases from the seven continuing HRS cohorts.  All group members have requested access and have obtained the 2018 Core HRS data. The data is rich in demographic information, health metrics, personal savings, aging measures, and retirement outcomes.
