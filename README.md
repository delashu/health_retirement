**Abstract**:   
The aging population in the United States has generated challenges impacting various facets of society. Retirement is one aspect of aging that affects the dynamic between personal health and the economy. This study sought to understand (i) the relationship between retirement status and health, demographic, and wealth measures, and (ii) the relationship between total asset possession and health, demography, and retirement status. Research has shown that financial preparedness leads to better retirement transition, while studies provide differing effects of retirement on wellbeing. Our study adds to this existing literature, while applying predictive modeling and clustering approaches that healthcare, government, and financial institutions may find helpful. The results of the inferential modeling approaches validate previous research showing life satisfaction and more comorbidities increase probability of being retired. The predictive model for retirement shows 86% hold-out test accuracy and test AUC of 0.92 that others may find practical.
